## CSE 15L: Researching Commands

#Intro:

Hello, my name is Brian Ponce. In this third lab report, I will be covering the Git Bash command, `less`.

# 1) -N:

Using the command line option `-N` using the `less` command displays the line numbers of each line in a text file

Example 1)

Input:

`less -N technical/911report/chapter-1.txt`

Output:

`4 "WE HAVE SOME PLANES"`

Example 2)

Input:

`less -N technical/911report/chapter-1.txt`

Output:

`6 Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States.`

-N is useful when want to extract a certain line of text in a large file. Knowing the line number will make it easier to find a certain passage that could be important to be aware of (e.g. finding the next section in a reading).
